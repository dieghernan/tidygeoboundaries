Online Usage
============

When using geoBoundaries on the web, we ask that you put the name
"geoBoundaries" with a link back to this website, www.geoboundaries.org,
somewhere prominent on the page that uses the boundaries. This can be a
stand-alone link or within a sentence.


Other
=====

If you are using geoBoundaries in a product that is not written or a website
(i.e., an application or movie), we ask that you put the name "geoBoundaries"
somewhere prominent in the product, for example in the credits or as a link in
the help menu. The full URL should be used if the user cannot click the name
- for example, we prefer "www.geoboundaries.org", rather than "geoBoundaries"
in those cases. We would also love to hear about unusual ways geoBoundaries
is being used - if you have a moment, please shoot us an email and let us know
what you're up to (team@geoboundaries.org)! If you have any cases that are not
covered here, we recommend reading the Creative Commons best practices for
attribution guide
(https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution),
which covers an even wider range of cases.
