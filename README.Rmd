## Why this package?  

The **geobounds** package provides an R-friendly interface to access and work with the [**geoBoundaries**](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) dataset (an open-license global database of administrative boundary polygons). Using this package, you can:

- Programmatically retrieve administrative boundary geometries (e.g., country → region → district) from geoBoundaries  
- Use tidyverse / **sf** workflows in **R** to map, analyse and join these boundaries with your own data  
- Work in an open-data context (geoBoundaries uses CC BY-4.0 / open licences)  

In short: if you work with geospatial boundaries in **R** (shape files, polygons, join with other data), this package simplifies the process.


## Installation

You can install the developing version of **geobounds** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dieghernan/geobounds")
```

Alternatively, you can install **geobounds** using the
[r-universe](https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev/geobounds):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install geobounds in R:
install.packages("geobounds",
  repos = c(
    "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Example usage  

```{r simple_plot}
library(geobounds)

spain_bounds <- get_geobn("ESP")
spain_adm1 <- get_geobn("ESP", boundary_type = "ADM1")

library(sf)
library(dplyr)

gal <- spain_adm1 %>%
  filter(shapeName == "Galicia")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(prov) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = gal, fill = "lightblue")


```

> Note: This is a simple illustration. See the package vignettes for full details on parameters, filters, caching, and advanced usage.
