[**Attribution**](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#usage) **is required
when using geoBoundaries.**

## Why this package?

The **geobounds** package provides an R-friendly interface to access and work
with the [**geoBoundaries**](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) dataset (an
open-license global database of administrative boundary polygons). Using this
package, you can:

-   Programmatically retrieve administrative boundary geometries (e.g., country
    → region → district) from geoBoundaries
-   Use tidyverse / **sf** workflows in **R** to map, analyse and join these
    boundaries with your own data
-   Work in an open-data context (geoBoundaries uses [CC
    BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) / open licences)

In short: if you work with geospatial boundaries in **R** (shape files,
polygons, join with other data), this package simplifies the process.

## Installation

You can install the developing version of **geobounds** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dieghernan/geobounds")
```

Alternatively, you can install **geobounds** using the
[r-universe](https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev/geobounds):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install geobounds in R:
install.packages("geobounds",
  repos = c(
    "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Example usage

```{r simple_plot, fig.alt="Map of all administration levels for Sri Lanka"}
library(geobounds)

sri_lanka_adm1 <- get_gb_adm1("Sri Lanka")
sri_lanka_adm2 <- get_gb_adm2("Sri Lanka")
sri_lanka_adm3 <- get_gb_adm3("Sri Lanka")

library(sf)
library(dplyr)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(sri_lanka_adm3) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#DFDFDF", color = "white") +
  geom_sf(data = sri_lanka_adm2, fill = NA, color = "#F0B323") +
  geom_sf(data = sri_lanka_adm1, fill = NA, color = "black") +
  labs(caption = "Source: www.geoboundaries.org") +
  theme_void()
```
