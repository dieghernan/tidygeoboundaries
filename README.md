## Why this package?

The **geobounds** package provides an R-friendly interface to access and
work with the [**geoBoundaries**](https://www.geoboundaries.org/)
dataset (an open-license global database of administrative boundary
polygons). Using this package, you can:

- Programmatically retrieve administrative boundary geometries (e.g.,
  country → region → district) from geoBoundaries  
- Use tidyverse / **sf** workflows in **R** to map, analyse and join
  these boundaries with your own data  
- Work in an open-data context (geoBoundaries uses CC BY-4.0 / open
  licences)

In short: if you work with geospatial boundaries in **R** (shape files,
polygons, join with other data), this package simplifies the process.

## Installation

You can install the developing version of **geobounds** with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dieghernan/geobounds")
```

Alternatively, you can install **geobounds** using the
[r-universe](https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev/geobounds):

``` r
# Install geobounds in R:
install.packages("geobounds",
  repos = c(
    "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Example usage

``` r
library(geobounds)

sri_lanka_bounds <- get_geobn("Sri Lanka")
sri_lanka_adm1 <- get_geobn("Sri Lanka", boundary_type = "ADM1")

library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.13.1, GDAL 3.10.2, PROJ 9.5.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Adjuntando el paquete: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

# Central
central <- sri_lanka_adm1 %>%
  filter(shapeISO == "LK-2")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(sri_lanka_bounds) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#F6E1B9") +
  geom_sf(data = sri_lanka_adm1, fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = central, fill = "#C12838") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#C7E7FB")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Central Province, Sri Lanka",
    caption = "Source: geoBoundaries"
  )
```
